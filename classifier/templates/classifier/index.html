    <h1>Classify</h1>

    <p class="lead">HydDB provides access to an accurate classifier for hydrogenase sequences and a curated database of
        hydrogenases by known type. The service is provided by the School of Biological Sciences, Monash University and
        the Bioinformatics Research Centre, Aarhus University.</p>

                    HydDB is unable to accurately check whether uploaded sequences correspond to hydrogenases or not.
                    Instead, it is well-suited for functionally-predictive classification of known hydrogenases into
                    different subgroups. Please ensure that all sequences that you upload correspond to catalytic
                    subunits of hydrogenases (e.g. using conserved domain database and phylogenetic trees). Sequences
                    that do not encode catalytic subunits of hydrogenases will still be classified, but the result may
                    be wrong.

                    <p>To use the classifier to predict the type of one or more hydrogenases from sequence, either:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>paste your FASTA-formatted protein sequences into the text area, or</li>
                        <li>upload a FASTA-formatted file with your protein sequences.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Press the "Submit" button to upload the sequences and begin the classification.</p>
                    <p>If you provided an e-mail address you will receive an e-mail when your job finishes or fails
                        including a link to the results. You will also be able to download the results as a CSV
                        file.</p>

                    <p>Only sequences encoding the catalytic subunits of hydrogenases will be classified, i.e. those
                        binding the [NiFe]-centre (NiFe-hydrogenases), [FeFe]-centre (FeFe-hydrogenases), or [Fe]-centre
                        (Fe-hydrogenases).Â Electron-transfer subunits, accessory proteins, and maturation factors cannot
                        be classified by this service.</p>

                    <h4>Limits</h4>
                    <p>A job can at most run for 2 hours and atmost 4000 sequences can be submitted.
                        This should be enough for about 2500 sequences to be classified. Results will be stored for 2
                        weeks. However, we recommend to download the results as they may be deleted due to the rare
                        event of a power outage or server crash.</p>
